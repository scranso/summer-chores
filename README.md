Summer Chores

This project is designed to run a set of chores that have a random chance of falling asleep before completing
or completing and calling the next chore to begin. If all chores are completed, a completion message will print.

- Feature 1: Random Number Generator (Math.random() < 0.2) to create a scenario where Sarah might fall asleep
before finishing the current chore/after finishing the most recent chore.
- Feature 2: setTimeout() to create the window in which Sarah is working on the chore and could call asleep.
- Feature 3: callback to call other functions and ultimately call doSummerChores to kick off the callback Hell.
  (I still feel like I have a pretty tenuous grasp on this concept. I just know this works. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )
